Learning Kubernetes from Scratch
This repository contains resources and notes to help you learn Kubernetes from scratch.

What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes provides a way to manage containers at scale, making it easier to deploy and manage complex applications in a distributed environment.

Prerequisites
Before you start learning Kubernetes, you should have a basic understanding of containerization and some experience working with Docker. You should also have some experience working with the command line and a basic understanding of networking and system administration.

Getting Started
To get started with Kubernetes, you'll need to set up a Kubernetes cluster. There are a few ways to do this, but one of the easiest is to use a managed Kubernetes service like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

Once you have a cluster set up, you can start learning the basics of Kubernetes by creating and managing Kubernetes objects like pods, services, and deployments. You can also explore more advanced topics like scaling, rolling updates, and load balancing.
